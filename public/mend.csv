This agreement aims to set the stage for a ceasefire and subsequent discussions on peace and political issues.The meeting, facilitated by the German special envoy for peace, was part of ongoing efforts to address the deadlock in peace talks, which had stalled since May 2017. Dr. Jibril Ibrahim, head of the JEM, emphasized that this meeting was crucial for progressing the peace process.The German government, in its efforts to revive the peace negotiations, had previously invited the parties for informal consultations. These talks had failed to yield results due to disagreements over the 2011 Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which the Sudanese government insisted upon as the basis for negotiations, while the rebel movements rejected it. The Berlin meeting was attended by representatives from the Troika countries (UK, US, and Norway), France, the European Union, and the head of the African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID)..... ""Also the Sudanese armed movements that have been meeting with the delegation of the Government of Sudan in Berlin, Germany, expressed hope for a positive outcome of their informal consultations this week.The consultations about the continuation of the peace process between the parties started in the German capital on Monday.

The German government has invited the parties for informal consultations.""UNAMID Updates — Jeremiah Mamabolo, the Head of UNAMID, reported that the security situation in Darfur remains generally calm, with only sporadic clashes in some areas. UNAMID is currently reconfiguring its forces, including establishing a new Temporary Operating Base at Golo in Jebel Marra. While the reconfiguration has involved withdrawing from some areas, Mamabolo noted no adverse impacts so far. He expressed cautious optimism about the peace process, citing a desire for continued engagement from the parties and ongoing efforts to bridge differences for a pre-negotiation framework.Additional Context — The Sudanese government and the Darfuri armed groups' meeting in Berlin represented a significant step towards addressing long-standing conflicts and moving towards a comprehensive peace agreement.

This has become even more urgent considering the decision of the AU and the UN to speed up UNAMID’s exit from Darfur. In this regard, UNAMID was urged to coordinate the convening of a meeting of all IFC partners for a review of the modalities of implementation that will reinvigorate the implementation of the DDPD.The meeting called on all negotiating parties (Government of Sudan, Justice and Equality Movement (JEM Gibril) and Sudan Liberation Army/Movement- Minni Minawi (SLA/M-MM) to speed up and finalize the ongoing negotiations that will lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities agreement. The meeting also called on Abdul Wahid Noor to reconsider his position of continuing the conflict and for him to engage in peaceful negotiationsThe meeting in applauding the efforts of the State of Qatar, welcomed the new Chairperson of the IFC, Dr. Mutlaq Majed Alqahtani and appreciated the role played by the former Chairperson, His Excellency Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, Deputy Prime Minister of Qatar and Foreign Minister.

Following the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir on April 11, the military and opposition have struggled to agree on the structure of a transitional government. The AU and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have been working to facilitate a return to direct talks between the two sides.... The AU has also suspended Sudan over transition feet dragging whiles Ethiopia waded in as a third-party mediator.Unified AU-Ethiopian mediation has submitted their proposal for #Sudan‘s political transition. Vital that the two sides, FFC and TMC, seize this opportunity to agree a deal now and build stability. Would be great for 30 June to be a day of celebration, rather than new protests.""...Protesters and opposition groups that are demanding the military hand over power to civilian rule said Thursday it received a new proposal for a transition drafted by Ethiopia and the African Union.The new proposal calls for a civilian-majority ruling council as demanded by protesters, but it fails to mention the make-up of a new transitional parliament.“The Alliance for Freedom and Change received the draft… and will be considering the proposal to make a decision,” the umbrella group said in a statement.The move comes after Sudan’s ruling generals urged mediators from the AU and Ethiopia to unify their efforts and come up with a joint proposal on the country’s transition.It entails creating a 15-member, civilian-majority governing body for a three-year transitional period.But it makes no mention of the composition of a legislative body.An earlier proposal drafted by Ethiopia had stipulated a transitional parliament of 300 lawmakers, with 67 percent of them from the Alliance for Freedom and Change.The remaining 33 percent were to be from other political groups, excluding now ousted longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir defunct National Congress Party....Kabbashi had earlier said the Transitional Military Council, TMC, had not even looked at the Ethiopian plan because it was from only one stakeholder.Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was in Khartoum earlier this month after special forces forcibly broke up a sit-in killing hundreds and injuring many more.The junta and protest leaders had cut all contact despite Abiy’s envoy managing to secure an agreement for resumption. The protesters have since called for a mediator saying they had lost trust in the TMC.An earlier proposal by Abiy Ahmed had been accepted by the protesters but rejected by the military. The new joint proposal from the AU and Ethiopia now aims to provide a basis for renewed negotiations, with the goal of establishing a civilian-led transitional administration in Sudan.",https://www.france24.com/en/20190629-sudan-generals-say-au-ethiopian-plan-basis-talks-with-protesters;http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sudan-generals-say-au-ethiopian-plan-basis-for-talks-with-protesters/article/553015;https://www.africanews.com/2019/06/29/sudan-s-army-accepts-au-ethiopia-transition-proposal-as-protestors-plan/;https://allafrica.com/stories/201906300044.html;https://www.africanews.com/2019/05/20/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-down-govt-sources/,0,M

Despite some progress, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) dismissed the negotiations, demanding that a document between the ruling generals and the protest movement prioritize peace negotiations and include rebel representatives in the transitional government.The TMC's delegation, including General Daglo and his team, concluded their visit to South Sudan without reaching a final agreement with SPLM, highlighting the ongoing challenges in the peace process.""",http://sudantribune.com/spip.php?article65984;https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/sudan-generals-protest-leaders-meet-rebel-chiefs-in-south-sudan/1658558/;https://tribune.com.pk/story/2023177/3-sudan-generals-protest-leaders-meet-rebel-chiefs-s-sudan/;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-07/28/c_138264994.htm;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2019/07/29/2003719547;http://www.jordantimes.com/news/region/sudan%C2%A0generals-protest-leaders-meet-rebel-chief-south-sudan;https://www.albawaba.com/news/sudan-opposition-cancels-peace-negotiations-govt-formation-1300036,0,M

The deal, which finalizes the constitutional declaration initially inked on August 4, aims to pave the way for a transitional government and eventual elections.The agreement was reached after nearly eight months of intense upheaval and protests against Bashir, who was ousted in April after 30 years in power. The deal was brokered with strong mediation from the African Union and Ethiopia. The signing ceremony, held in Khartoum, was attended by international representatives, including the presidents of Chad, Kenya, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan, as well as the prime ministers of Egypt and Ethiopia, and other prominent figures such as Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs.The deal has been welcomed by both the military council and the opposition coalition, the Alliance for Freedom and Change. The agreement was seen as a crucial step in restoring stability to Sudan, which has been grappling with an economic crisis and a volatile regional context. The compromise, while addressing several key demands of the protest camp, allows the military to retain significant powers, posing ongoing challenges for the future civilian government.In a notable development, Sudan’s Sovereign Council was sworn in on August 21, with Abdalla Hamdok appointed as Prime Minister. This event marked a significant milestone in Sudan’s transition to democracy. The swearing-in was celebrated by many Sudanese in Khartoum, reflecting their hopes for the future.The signing of the agreement received broad international support, with the European Union and other global partners witnessing the ceremony. The UN Security Council, the EU, and the Troika (the US, UK, and Norway) all expressed support for the agreement. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also extended congratulations and support to the transitional authorities.The formation of the Sovereign Council and the appointment of the Prime Minister are seen as critical steps in Sudan’s journey toward peace, democracy, and prosperity. The road ahead remains challenging, but the international and regional backing provides a foundation for hopeful progress in Sudan’s transition.""While four regional leaders of South Sudan, Chad, Kenya and the Ethiopian Prime Minister will attend the ceremony, the Egyptian President who is the head of the African Union declined the invitation as will be represented by his Prime Minister Mostafa Kemal Madbouly.Expected to arrive in Khartoum, Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Hamad Al Sabah-First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait, Adel Al-Jubeir Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa Bahrain’s Foreign Minister and Yousef Al-Othaimeen the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

In the opening session, Jeremiah Mamabolo, the UNAMID Joint Special Representative, praised South Sudan for its role in facilitating the negotiations and called on all parties to demonstrate leadership and commitment to the peace process. The international community, including the US, UK, and Norway (the Troika), has expressed support for the resumption of talks and urged all sides to cooperate without preconditions.The negotiations in Juba come after the successful conclusion of the first round on October 14, and the second round, which was briefly postponed.

This new agreement addresses issues like filling the GERD’s reservoir, policies regulating water release during droughts and procedures for handling emergencies related to the dam. The agreement was announced in Sudan on February 14. The United States, taking the role of “external mediator,” hosted a late January meeting in Washington that helped hammer out the “joint responsibility” for managing drought crises agreement.

""On February 29, 2020, Egypt signed a U.S.-sponsored agreement in Washington regarding Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and urged Ethiopia and Sudan to join the agreement as soon as possible.

A ministerial meeting involving the water and foreign ministers from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan was scheduled for February 27-28 in Washington to finalize the rules for filling and operating the GERD. However, Ethiopia announced a day before the meeting that it would not participate in the talks, citing unfinished consultations with national stakeholders. Following the U.S.-brokered talks, Ethiopia rejected the draft agreement, stating that the text reportedly initialed by Egypt did not reflect the outcomes of negotiations with Sudan and Egypt. Ethiopia criticized the U.S. characterization of the negotiation process as complete and announced plans to proceed with the dam's first filling.

These comprise a Darfur Agreement between the TGOS and 'Darfur Parties to Peace' (Title 2); a 'Two Areas' agreements between TGOS and the The Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North / The Revolutionary Front (Title 3); the Eastern Sudan Track Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 4); Track 5, Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front - Northern Track (Title 5); Agreement of the Central Track between the TSGO and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 6); and Security arrangements between the TSGO and the Third-Front - Tamazuj (Title 7). While the agreements are all varied, they provide on the most part for some representation of these areas in the transitional government and/or wider institutional structures of the transition, and for new governance and security and economic / development provision within each area. The Agreement therefore in its totality in a sense connects the wider armed conflict with different groups, or different factions or branches of the same broad group, with the transition process focused on the move from military rule at the level of the central state, and with the Transitional government (itself a mixed military-civilian government).

""We, the regionalists - Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, Central Asian countries and India - believe that the priority should be to create inclusive leadership in Afghanistan. And creating such a leadership structure will lead to the resolution of other very important issues like women’s rights in Afghanistan,"" he explained.

The letter stressed that the UN, its representatives, and staff should not communicate with “terrorist organizations” along with “groups and their affiliated illegal administrative entities in northwestern Syria”. It reiterated the Syrian government’s demand that the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) be allowed to supervise and facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in “areas controlled by terrorist organizations in northwest Syria”. On 14 July, OCHA circulated a note to Council members that responded to the Syrian government’s 13 July letter. The note stated that the “Syrian Government’s permission can be a basis for the [UN] to lawfully conduct cross-border humanitarian operations via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing for the specified duration”. However, it also said that the Syrian government’s letter contained two unacceptable conditions: that the UN should not communicate with entities designated as “terrorist”, and that the ICRC and the SARC should supervise and facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in northwest Syria. In this regard, the OCHA note said that the UN and its implementing partners must continue to engage with relevant state and non-state parties as operationally necessary to carry out safe and unimpeded humanitarian operations in line with the mandate of the Emergency Relief Coordinator under the General Assembly resolution 46/182.

In recent months, the Arab media has been rife with reports suggesting that Israel is actively pursuing the normalization of relations with countries such as Mauritania, Somalia, Niger, Indonesia and Libya with US involvement. But Nouakchott severed relations which had been strained by a 2009 Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip. Israel released 1,027 PA Arab and Arab-Israeli security prisoners in exchange for the soldier, who was abducted by Hamas in 2006. Despite opposition from some Muslim clerics in Mauritania against normalizing relations with Israel in recent years, Mauritania supported the Abraham Accords, in which the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco normalized relations with Israel in 2020. According to the Lebanon-based Al-Khandaq, David Meidan, a former Mossad official who currently works in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, met with an advisor to Mauritania’s intelligence chief.

The group meeting Mr Blinken was convened by Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman al-Safadi, who said the gathering was organised “in the context of their efforts aimed at stopping the Israeli war on Gaza and the humanitarian catastrophe it is causing”, according to the ministry.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back against growing US pressure for a “humanitarian pause” in the nearly month-old war to protect civilians and allow more aid into Gaza, insisting there would be no temporary cease-fire until the roughly 240 hostages held by Hamas are released. Blinken, in a blunt call for Israel to pause military operations in the territory to allow for the immediate and increased delivery of assistance, said the current situation would drive Palestinians toward further radicalism and effectively end prospects for any eventual resumption of peace talks to end the conflict. “There will be no partners for peace if they’re consumed by humanitarian catastrophe and alienated by any perceived indifference to their plight,” Blinken said, even as the call for a temporary pause without the release by Hamas of Israeli hostages was swiftly rejected by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Israel would be “going with full steam ahead.” The comments to reporters in Tel Aviv, following meetings with Netanyahu and other senior officials, amounted to some of the Biden administration’s strongest warnings to Israel.",https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2023/nov/04/us-israel-differ-over-pause-in-military-operations-in-gaza-whiledeath-toll-crosses-9220-2630028.html,1,M

David Barnea, head of Israel's Mossad intelligence service, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met one day after Qatar announced the two-day extension of an original four-day truce deal in Gaza that had been due to expire overnight. Qatar, where several political leaders of Hamas are based, has been leading negotiations between the Palestinian militant group and Israel. The truce has brought the first respite to the Gaza Strip in seven weeks during which Israel bombed the territory heavily in response to a violent rampage on Oct. 7 by Hamas gunmen who killed around 1,200 people and took 240 captives. As part of the two-day truce extension Hamas has agreed to release an additional 10 Israeli women and children each day....Burns arrived in Qatar on Tuesday for secret meetings with Israel’s spy chief and Qatar’s prime minister aimed at brokering an expansive deal between Israel and Hamas, said three people familiar with the visit. Burns is pushing for Hamas and Israel to broaden the focus of their ongoing hostage negotiations, thus far limited to women and children, to encompass the release of men and military personnel, too. A U.S. official said, “Director Burns traveled to Doha for meetings about the Israel-Hamas conflict including continued discussion on hostages.” U.S. officials are pushing for a longer string of days without fighting to release hostages and allow humanitarian aid into the enclave. Israel remains open to proposals to include men and military personnel in the hostage releases, but is insisting that all remaining children and civilian women be released before any additional deals are made, said an Israeli official familiar with the negotiations.... The outcome of the talks, which were also attended by Egyptian officials, was unclear, the source added.

The plan has been drafted by Egypt and Hamas will record their “observations” today. Sources close to Hamas say Cairo’s three-stage plan provides for renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and ultimately a ceasefire to end the war sparked by the deadly 7th October attack on Israel, Agence France-Presse reports. A high-level delegation from the Hamas political office will visit Cairo tomorrow to meet Egyptian officials and give the response of the Palestinian factions, including several observations, to their plan..... Egypt and Qatar are working in parallel to create a deal, as Israel hopes that one of the two will see success. According to a source with knowledge of the details, the discussion is now focusing on a humanitarian deal, but the prices that Israel will have to pay in terms of days of respite and the release of prisoners will be ""heavier."" Meanwhile, Channel 12 News reported that the Qatari proposal, still in the preliminary stages, would during the first stage include the release of 40-50 hostages, in exchange for a complete ceasefire of one month. An Egyptian proposal would include a first stage in which Israel will stop the fighting for at least two or three weeks, and Hamas would release 40 hostages in return for 120 terrorists.

Sources close to the workshop revealed that the Sudanese army had reservations about attending, while the RSF initially expressed their approval. However, as of late Monday evening, there was no confirmation of their representatives’ arrival in Cairo.The RSF, a paramilitary group that controls four out of five states in Darfur, has been engaged in fierce clashes with the Sudanese army since October 2023.The workshop will focus on two key topics: 1) achieving a ceasefire in Darfur and 2) establishing a joint committee between the military authorities in the region to reduce tensions and promote coordination.Among the armed movements attending the workshop are the Secretary of Presidential Affairs of the Gathering of Sudan Liberation Forces, Brigadier General Mubarak Bakhit, and the Vice President of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) led by Suleiman Sandal, Gibril Adam Bilal. Additionally, Seif al-Din Issa, Advisor to the President of the Sudan Liberation Movement Transitional Council (SLM-TC, is also participating.However, the participation of the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Minni Arko Minawi remains uncertain. While the Justice and Equality Movement led by Gibril Ibrahim decided to boycott the meeting. Hassan Ibrahim Fadl, JEM Spokesman acknowledged their invitation to the workshop but expressed their regret for not attending. In a statement on Monday night, he explained that the JEM decided to withdraw after learning that the RSF was invited to participate in the meeting.The groups said that the RSF should implement the Jeddah Declaration to Cessation of Hostilities, signed on May 11, 2023, which stipulates the withdrawal of the paramilitary group from civilian areas",https://sudantribune.com/article281586/,0,M

He emphasised the importance of making the role “attractive” from the Taliban’s perspective.He went on to highlight the necessity of overcoming the deadlock by creating a roadmap that addresses both the concerns of the international community and those of the Taliban.",https://dohanews.co/un-chief-guterres-labels-talibans-terms-for-un-doha-meeting-as-unacceptable/;https://www.khaama.com/russian-envoy-to-attend-un-doha-meeting-on-afghanistan/;https://www.ariananews.af/us-says-it-firmly-supports-unscs-move-to-appoint-special-envoy-for-afghanistan/;https://www.khaama.com/taliban-sets-two-conditions-for-participation-at-doha-meeting-iranian-envoy/;https://tribune.com.pk/story/2456678/pakistan-to-attend-crucial-afghan-conference-in-doha;https://www.dw.com/en/can-un-afghanistan-conference-succeed-without-the-taliban/a-68279865;https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-doha-meeting-to-offer-chance-for-constructive-dialogue-on-afghanistan/7491153.html;https://www.khaama.com/pakistans-asif-durrani-to-attend-doha-meeting-on-afghanistan/;https://tribune.com.pk/story/2456678/pakistan-to-attend-crucial-afghan-meeting-in-doha;https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/2/17/the-inclusive-afghan-government-afghans-do-not-want;https://www.firstpost.com/world/afghanistan-special-envoys-to-meet-in-doha-13738880.html;https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/afghanistan-special-envoys-to-meet-in-doha/article;https://www.samaa.tv/208739917-un-special-envoys-in-doha-to-discuss-future-of-afghanistan;https://www.qatar-tribune.com/article/108623/latest-news/under-un-auspices-qatar-hosts-2nd-meeting-of-special-envoys-on-afghanistan;https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1159176-afghanistan-special-envoys-meet-in-doha;https://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/World/20240219/4170216.html;https://tribune.com.pk/story/2456957/un-doha-huddle-delivers-clear-message-to-taliban-regime;https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/secretary-generals-press-encounter-meeting-special-envoys-afghanistan-19-february-2024;https://thediplomat.com/2024/02/un-doha-conference-on-afghanistan-fails-to-achieve-key-goals/;https://www.khaama.com/us-state-dept-spokesperson-not-surprised-by-talibans-absence-at-un-doha/;https://tribune.com.pk/story/2457302/taliban-boycott-of-doha-huddle-termed-blunder;https://www.ariananews.af/strong-consensus-on-collective-interests-in-afghanistan-exist-thomas-west/;https://www.khaama.com/the-international-community-supports-people-of-afghanistan-rina-amiri/;https://www.eurasiareview.com/27022024-who-will-talk-to-afghanistans-taliban-analysis/;https://indiandefencereview.com/afghanistan-where-lies-the-problem/;https://thefrontierpost.com/focus-of-discussions-in-global-meetings-in-solar-year-1402/;https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/02/afghanistan-private-meeting-2.php;https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/secretary-generals-press-encounter-meeting-special-envoys-afghanistan-19-february-2024-doha-qatar;https://thefrontierpost.com/international-community-supports-people-of-afghanistan-rina/;https://www.khaama.com/us-firmly-supports-unscs-appointment-of-special-envoy-for-afghanistan/,0,MR

This agreement took place during a tripartite meeting on Sunday in Cairo at the invitation of the Secretary General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, in an effort to bring views closer and end the political impasse through a Libyan-Libyan dialogue. The statement of the heads of the three councils stressed the necessity of forming a unified government responsible for supervising the electoral process and providing the necessary services to Libyans. They also agreed to hold a second round urgently to complete this agreement and bring it into effect, while calling on the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and the international community to support its outcomes. The statement indicated that the meeting parties agreed to unify sovereign positions to ensure the activation of their role at the level of the Libyan state. It stressed Libya's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and rejected any negative external interference in the political process. The host country, Egypt, considered the outcomes of the meeting an important step on the path to achieving the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people. In a statement issued by the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the meeting, Egypt welcomed the Arab League’s hosting of the meeting between Menfi, Takala and Saleh, explaining that this meeting comes “within the framework of supporting the exclusive Libyan ownership of the political settlement, and strengthening the role of Libyan institutions in fulfilling all necessary frameworks for holding presidential and parliamentary elections.....

Other participants were the chairman of the High Council of State, Mohammed Takala, and Aguila Saleh, the influential speaker of the House of Representatives in Benghazi, considered as a counterpart to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

The two also agreed to convene work teams from both nations in Washington to produce “alternative approaches for an operation in Rafah.” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan later added that the White House would look to present a more pinpoint alternative to a full incursion into the city, Hamas’s last Gazan stronghold. “A major ground operation there would be a mistake. It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally,” Sullivan said. Sullivan also confirmed the death in an Israeli strike last week of Hamas’s third in command in Gaza, Marwan Issa. Sullivan said, “the rest of the top leaders are in hiding, likely deep in the Hamas tunnel network and justice will come for them too. We are helping them to ensure that.” Meanwhile, on a visit to the Philippines, US Secretary of State Blinken again urged that more aid be sent to Gaza, claiming that the entire population was experiencing “severe levels of acute food insecurity.”",https://www.bicom.org.uk/news/march-19th-day-165-of-the-war-news-in-brief/,0,MR

Pedersen; Joyce Msuya,,,,,0,,0,,,"On 21 March, Pedersen and Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Joyce Msuya briefed the Council on the political and humanitarian tracks in Syria, respectively. Pedersen underscored that Syria faces a negative trajectory with respect to political, security, humanitarian, human rights, and economic conditions. Noting that the political track remains “blocked and dormant”, he urged the Syrian government to “engage in a deepened and concrete dialogue” and said that it had rejected his offer to hold the ninth round of the Constitutional Committee in Geneva at the end of April. (The Syrian opposition, represented by the Syrian Negotiations Commission [SNC], accepted Pedersen’s proposal). In her remarks at the meeting, Msuya provided an overview of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country.

Pedersen,,,,,0,,0,,,"On 30 May, Special Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths briefed the Council on the political and humanitarian tracks in Syria, respectively. Griffiths provided an overview of the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the country and the devastating consequences of the persisting insecurity on civilians. He apprised members of a recent uptick in hostilities in Deir-ez-Zor governorate in eastern Syria, particularly near the UN humanitarian hub, which damaged humanitarian assets and led to the temporary suspension of humanitarian operations. He also spoke about the situation of women and girls in the country, noting that they continue to be exposed to appalling levels of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, exploitation, and abuse. Griffiths called on relevant parties to allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief while taking note of the lack of progress in cross-line delivery of aid—that is, across domestic conflict lines from Syrian government-held areas into areas outside government control. Lack of necessary approvals and security guarantees, among other things, continue to impede the cross-line delivery of humanitarian assistance....In his remarks at the 30 May meeting, Pedersen said that there was no clear path emerging to implementing resolution 2254 of 18 December 2015, which focused on finding a political solution to the Syrian crisis, including through the reconvening of the Syrian Constitutional Committee. Efforts to resume the Constitutional Committee remain stalled. He underlined the importance of preparing for a new and more comprehensive approach, noting that there must be a political horizon to resolve complex conflicts instead of managing or containing them in perpetuity. Highlighting the lack of trust among the stakeholders, he said that only concrete engagement, coordination and action could bring reciprocal and verifiable progress. The absence of a way forward threatens to cause prolonged division and despair. (For background and more information, see our Syria brief in the June Monthly Forecast and 24 June What’s in Blue story.) ...Pedersen also described the ongoing hostilities and persisting security tensions within Syria, including insurgent activities by some tribal elements against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a primarily Kurdish group opposing the Syrian government; the violent crackdown on protestors in Idlib by the Security Council-listed terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham; and ongoing protests in al-Sweida governorate, which started in August 2023 against the backdrop of the deteriorating economic situation in the country. He stressed the need for urgent de-escalation across all the frontlines within Syria and in the region, starting with a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. He also took note of the upcoming parliamentary elections in government-controlled areas, scheduled for July, adding that these elections cannot be a substitute for an inclusive political process, as envisioned in resolution 2254.",https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-07/syria-69.php;https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/absent-political-progress-ongoing-violence-putting-syria-global-community-terrible-risks-special-envoy-syria-warns-security-council,0,MR

Indian officials worry that the U.S., desperate to strike a peace deal before its troops depart, will allow Pakistan to play a driving role in the talks. Pakistan has long relied on the Taliban to serve as its proxy for maintaining influence in the country. If the Taliban regains influence in Afghanistan without agreeing to participate in a normal political process or relinquishing violence, Afghanistan will again become a haven for international terrorists, and support for Islamist extremist ideologies will flourish throughout the region. Since then, the Vienna Process has gained further momentum, “having brought together 40 different parties, including Afghan organizations such as women’s movements, civil society, media representatives, and influential individuals.” We experienced the diversity of Afghan voices firsthand when we took part in the fourth meeting of the Vienna Process in June 2024.

Unlike the Doha Process, the Vienna Process is an inclusive platform that invites all Afghan sides, including the Taliban, to join the effort to free Afghanistan from fear, terror, drugs, and want. Coming together under the Vienna Process to build on the progress made so far is an opportunity no serious Afghan side should miss.

Taliban officials participated, which they had not in the first two Doha meetings, in May 2023 and in February. Over 25 countries and international organisations took part in the meeting. The discussion focused on two tracks: economic matters (including developing the private sector) and counter-narcotics. As an outgrowth of the meeting, working groups are expected to be established on private sector economic matters and counter-narcotics that will develop lines of communication between the Taliban and donor countries and states in the region. Civil society representatives (including women) were excluded from the discussion.Briefing the press following the meeting, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, who represented the UN, indicated that although the de facto authorities (that is, the Taliban) would not “sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format…they heard very clearly the need to include women and civil society in all aspects of public life”.…“A delegation of the Islamic Emirate will participate in the coming Doha conference.

The way out of the current dead end and Afghanistan’s subsequent international reintegration depend on this.""Meanwhile, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan Roza Otunbayeva said that the United Nations welcomes Taliban’s willingness to take part in an UN conference on Afghanistan in Doha and thinks that this is essential for beginning the process of building trust between the Taliban and the world community.…According to the Afghan official, the agenda of the meeting includes efforts to counter narcotics and discuss alternatives for the poppy growers; financial and banking issues; and, climate change.Like Pakistan, freak weather events have badly affected Afghanistan in recent years, with floods and earthquakes wreaking havoc across large swathes of the country.While observers believe that the Doha talks may well pave the way for further progress on several key issues, there is a recognition that a lot of important matters are being left out of the discussion just to maintain a cordial atmosphere.…The third Doha meeting, unlike the first and second meetings, which were held under the supervision of António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, will be conducted under the oversight of Rosemary DiCarlo, Guterres’s deputy...Previously, an official from the Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the agenda of the Doha meeting has been shared with the group, and the discussions will focus on issues related to the private sector, finance, banking, and combating drug trafficking.…Officials from the UN confirmed that their talks with the Taliban next week in Doha on the future of war-torn Afghanistan will be held without the presence of Afghan women at the table.This will be the first meeting between the Taliban and 22 other international envoys since the takeover of Kabul by the group in 2021 after the US and Nato forces left the country.Roza Otunbayeva, the UN special envoy for Afghanistan, defended the decision to keep women and civil society members out of the crucial talks....The upcoming dialogue is being held to discuss the war-torn nation’s future, economic crisis, drug addiction impacting millions and stability in the region, and excludes talks on women’s and humanitarian rights violations by the Taliban.…The UN-sponsored talks on Afghanistan to be held in Doha, Qatar on June 30 and July 1 will be crucial because the Afghan Taliban government has been formally invited in the parleys, unlike in the earlier two rounds, to become part of dialogue to explore strategies for peace and stability in that war-torn country.…U.N. Special Envoy Roza Otunbayeva, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, is holding a meeting with the Taliban and envoys from 22 countries to ask the Taliban to protect women’s rights. Absent from this meeting are Afghan women, the ones who are being oppressed by the fundamentalist Islamic regime that blocks them from working, leaving the home, or going to school.Otunbayeva insists “nobody dictated” that women must be left out of the meeting, meaning that the U.N. chose to make that part of the procedure in keeping with its tradition of pandering to the worst governments in the world. The U.N. had already been working toward recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan once the Taliban took over the country again, and Otunbayeva is going to legitimize them further in a useless meeting in which U.N. officials will ask very nicely for the Taliban to respect women, and the Taliban will laugh and go on with their normal activities.…The upcoming UN-led Doha meeting on Afghanistan will be chaired by the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peace building Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo on behalf of the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.…The United Nations proves yet again that it is without a shred of credibility, especially when it comes to the rights of women.Capitulating to terrorists isn't a good look. The United Nations is holding a conference on Afghanistan in Doha beginning on June 30. It is scheduled to discuss the international community's approach to Afghanistan. Women's rights are not on the agenda. Also, the Taliban is demanding that Afghan women be shut out from participating in the conference.…Both US special representatives for Afghanistan Thomas West and Rina Amiri will attend the third UN-convened meeting in Doha on Afghanistan, the State Department . . .…The UN-led meeting aims to engage with the Islamic Emirate on various issues including engagement going forward, along with sessions on private sector business and counter-narcotics.This UN official also says that the work on appointing a UN special representative for Afghanistan is currently pending and will not be discussed in the Doha meeting....We participate in this meeting to pressure the Taliban (Islamic Emirate) together with the international community to fulfill their obligations to the Doha Agreement, including their behavior towards women,” said Miller.Previously, Rina Amiri, the US special representative for women, girls and human rights in Afghanistan, said that until the issue of human rights is included in the agenda of the future talks in Afghanistan, conflicts will continue in this country.…Fast-forward seven years, and the diplomatic circus surrounding the United Nations-led Doha meetings of special representatives for Afghanistan, set for a third round from June 30 to July 1...News reports suggest that the “Doha 3” official agenda will cover a wide range of items intended as inducements to get the Taliban on board with issues that too many in the international community apparently consider a higher priority than human rights and the subjugation of women. These apparent priority issues include discussions on counter-narcotics measures and related incentives to offer alternative livelihoods to opium poppy growers, as well as issues related to climate change and the environment, banking and financial flows, and the role of the private sector in all of the above (in a weak effort by the organizers to demonstrate that they are engaging with players other than the Taliban)....There is, rhetorically at least, also an agreement among Security Council members on what a sustainable outcome should look like. As described in the independent assessment and reinforced by Security Council Resolution 2721 that followed in December, the end goal is “an Afghanistan at peace with itself and its neighbors, fully reintegrated into the international community and meeting international obligations.” The resolution also says the Council “recognizes the need to ensure the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of Afghan women in the process throughout.”Under “any other business” at the end of the meeting, some participants have indicated they might, if time permits, raise other issues such as the Taliban’s assault on human rights, girls’ education and permission for women to work, and questions related to migration, a potential national dialogue that some advocates have called for, and the possible appointment of a U.N. special representative, which the Taliban has resisted.…The UN’s Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Afghanistan has stated that if women are excluded from the Doha talks due to the Taliban’s presence, the cost of such exclusion would be very significant.….Benett stated, “Following talks with the Taliban, the agenda of the session will focus on drug trafficking and aiding the private sector.” He added that human rights or women’s issues will not be discussed, and women or civil society representatives will not participate.…The meeting was opened at 8:45pm with opening remarks by UN Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, followed by welcoming remarks from Qatari officials. The talks will conclude tomorrow.Pakistan is also attending the talks, with the delegation being led by Asif Khan Durrani, the country’s special representative on Afghanistan.Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani, Islamabad’s envoy in Kabul, is also part of the delegation.There are two items on the official agenda, which has been seen by Dawn.com: enabling the private sector, and countering narcotics and sustaining progress.…Two days of UN-organized talks on international relations with Taliban-led Afghanistan were getting under way in the Qatari capital, Doha, on June 30, with the Taliban present for the first time -- but rights groups expressed anger over the hard-line fundamentalist regime’s exclusion of women and its refusal to discuss women's rights at the forum.…It has been reported that Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and the host of this meeting, will speak at the beginning of the meeting.Following her, Qatar’s representative as the host country will address the gathering, and then Zabihullah Mujahid, the head of the Taliban’s negotiating team, will deliver a speech. The agenda allows each special representative to speak on their topic for up to three minutes thereafter.Zakir Jalali, the Head of the Third Political Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Taliban, said in a tweet that on the second day of the Doha meeting, discussions will focus on financial and banking sanctions, the private sector, combating narcotics, and maintaining progress. …ISTANBULThe Taliban-led Afghan interim administration Sunday called for “delineating” Afghanistan’s internal matters from foreign relations to achieve “advancements” in bilateral and multilateral engagements. Besides, it put forward three key requirements before the international community to help the war-torn nation make progress as it battles poverty, broken economy, and weak healthcare.These needs were key parts of a statement delivered by the Afghan interim administration’s chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as the two-day UN-hosted meeting on Afghanistan opened in Qatari capital Doha.The key areas include removing all restrictions and sanctions on Afghanistan’s banking sector, unfreezing central bank reserves of around $7 billion and providing alternative livelihood to the nation’s farmers as drug crop and processing has entirely been banned.…About the UN-sponsored talks with Afghanistan that began in Doha on Monday, he said it was ""useful"" but was sceptical of its outcome.""Everybody wishes well to Afghanistan, but the roadmap how to do it is different from country to country and the devil is in the details,"" he said.The West prioritised human rights and ""genuine rights"" of women and girls in dealing with the Taliban regime, he added.""We also are saying that, of course, the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan should be observed and that the government of Afghanistan should be inclusive, inclusive, not just by nationalities but by... the political spectrum that exists to represent the country fully,"" he said.But the ""Taliban is de-facto authorities within Afghanistan and we've been saying consistently that you have to recognise this fact,"" Nebenzia added.…The UN says the talks are part of an ongoing process aimed at a future where Afghanistan is at peace internally and with its neighbours, fully integrated into the international community and where it meets international obligations, including on human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls.…Doha, Qatar: Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo has said that the third meeting of special envoys concerned with Afghanistan, being held in Doha, is largely fruitful and ongoing….She noted that the concerns and opinions of Afghan women and the civil society was important for the United Nations.“The meaningful inclusion of women in political and peace processes is a guiding principle. These issues have been raised in all sessions with the de facto authorities.”…The United Nations’ recent talks with the Taliban have brought to the forefront the complex and often contentious issue of women’s rights in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid’s assertion that women’s rights are an internal matter underscores the significant ideological chasm between the Taliban and the international community. The UN’s characterization of the Taliban’s stance as “gender apartheid” reflects a deep concern for the human rights abuses occurring under Taliban rule. This article critically analyzes the implications of these talks, their potential to resolve the issue, and their impact on global human rights and women’s rights.…The United Nations (UN) is facing criticism for holding talks with Taliban officials in Doha that expressly excluded Afghan civil society, ensuring that no Afghan women were present. Envoys from approximately twenty-five countries and regional organizations attended the meetings while insisting that the process was not a step toward formal recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate leaders of Afghanistan. The meetings focused on topics including narcotics and the private sector. At the Taliban’s insistence, human rights—including women’s rights—were off the table as they allege that these are issues that must be handled internally by Taliban officials in accordance with Islamic law. The UN did hold separate meetings for Afghan civil society representatives, but they were boycotted by many activists. “There was broad agreement on the need to chart a clear way forward,” said Rosemary DiCarlo, undersecretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs at the UN, adding, “Regrettably, the de facto authorities will not sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format.” …AHEAD of the recently concluded ‘Doha III’ talks on Afghanistan, the United Nations was in a bind.Bringing the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table was their primary goal, but it would require a deft touch and many balancing acts.Issues such as human rights, women’s treatment and education, as well as the resurgence of terror groups weighed heavily on the conscience of diplomats participating in these meetings of Special Envoys on Afghanistan.....It was a candid discussion with the Taliban, the first time they have met the international community collectively since the fall of Kabul,” a Doha-based Western diplomat told Dawn.He claimed that human rights, especially for women and girls, were discussed extensively.…Last week, in response to a UN initiative, Taliban representatives met in Doha, Qatar, with diplomats from 25 countries and international organizations to discuss the future of Afghanistan. Before the meeting even began, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid made clear that the issue of women's rights was an ""internal matter"" for Afghanistan and would not be on the agenda in Doha. Other countries, he insisted, needed to acknowledge Afghanistan's religious and cultural values.…Representatives of over two dozen countries and international organizations came to Doha at the end of June to meet with senior Taliban leaders as part of a UN-facilitated discussion. This interaction, commonly known as “Doha 3,” was the third part of an ongoing process initiated over a year ago in an effort to create a cohesive platform to deal with ground realities in Afghanistan. While the Taliban agreed for the first time to directly participate, their involvement did not yield any decisive outcomes, even though only non-contentious issues, such as facilitating business and boosting counter-narcotics measures, were on the agenda. Despite relegating discussions with Afghan women and civil society representatives to the sidelines of the main dialogue in order to ensure the Taliban’s participation, Western officials seemed reserved about conceding to Taliban requests to enable regional trade given concerns that it might primarily serve Chinese and Russian interests. Other critics of these Doha dialogues feel that they are not doing enough to try to hold the Taliban accountable for domestic human rights violations.…There are separate talks taking place hosted by the UN and Qatar. But here, too, the hosts agreed to the Taliban’s demands that no women’s organizations be represented and that the agenda for these talks would exclude education. The Taliban are seeking international recognition, including membership of the UN. Afghanistan desperately needs trade deals to revive an economy that is on its knees. Yet, it is unacceptable that the international community has effectively accepted Taliban conditions that there will be no formal talks on the education ban.…The United Nations has announced that the third Doha meeting, which will include special representatives for Afghanistan from various countries, will take place on June 30 and will last for two days.…The third UN-led Doha meeting on Afghanistan is scheduled for June 30, and diplomatic efforts are in full swing to seek the Taliban’s presence at the event. Qatar, the host, too, is keen to make the two-day huddle meaningful with the participation of Kabul representatives, unlike the previous two meeting…Faiz Mohammad Zaland, a representative of Afghan civil society present at the second Doha meeting, noted that the Taliban’s participation is conditional, with ongoing negotiations regarding the level of their representation.…The Doha meeting, scheduled for June 30 and July 1 at the United Nations initiative in Qatar’s capital, has influenced many regional meetings. The agendas of many of these meetings, including the Ankara meeting and a series of meetings by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Taliban, have been dedicated to consultations on this matter…This call was then repeated at the June 30-July 1 United Nations Doha meeting of special national envoys to Afghanistan. IEA government spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, who led the IEA delegation to the Doha meeting, thanked the nations at a follow-up press conference, naming Pakistan, Iran and others, which are supporting Kabul’s request to access its blocked funds.…India became one of the 25 nations that participated in the third UN-led conference on Afghanistan in Doha which commenced on Sunday. The meeting was touted as a significant one since it was the first time Afghanistan’s Taliban attended talks at an international level.Dujarric said that special representatives of the countries and the Deputy Secretary-General will meet with representatives of Afghan women and civil society on Tuesday......According to the statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, representatives from Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, India, Kazakhstan, and several other countries will attend the third Doha meeting.","https://thefrontierpost.com/un-to-host-third-doha-meeting-on-afghanistan-on-sunday/;https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-09/afghanistan-26.php

In a press release issued at the end of the discussions, Lamamra said that his team held around 20 sessions with the parties’ delegations, including technical and plenary meetings, in the context of their respective mandates. He noted that, during these engagements, the delegations expressed their positions on key issues of concern, thereby deepening mutual understanding. Lamamra described the discussions as an “encouraging initial step in a longer and complex process” and welcomed the commitments announced by “one of the two parties” to enhance Humanitarian assistance and the protection of civilians. At the end of proximity talks, the RSF reportedly sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General, outlining commitments it has made, including to facilitate Humanitarian aid deliveries in coordination with the RSF-affiliated Sudanese Agency for Relief and Humanitarian Operations (SARHO), to strengthen civilian protection measures, and to facilitate the safe passage of individuals and supplies. Media reports quoted Salwa Adam Benya, Sudan’s Humanitarian Aid Commissioner and the head of the SAF delegation, as saying in a statement that the proximity talks offered a “promising foundation” for addressing the Humanitarian crisis in the country and expressed Sudan’s commitment to cooperate with the UN “within existing national Humanitarian policies”.....

China and Egypt should seize this opportunity to fully implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders, and work towards building a China-Egypt community with a shared future in the new era, said Wang. Egypt is willing to work with China to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and strengthen high-level exchanges, in a bid to elevate bilateral relations, display broader prospects, and bring more benefits to the people of both countries, he said. In response to the Gaza conflict, China has proposed a three-step initiative: achieving a comprehensive ceasefire, promoting post-war governance in Gaza under the principle of ""the Palestinians governing Palestine,"" and effectively implementing the two-state solution, Wang noted. He also pointed out that China will continue to stand on the side of international justice, strengthen solidarity with Arab countries, and work with all parties to avoid further escalation and deterioration of the situation. Abdelatty expressed deep concern over the escalating situation in Gaza, emphasizing that the assassination of Haniyeh further complicates efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement and may even lead to a full-scale regional war. The Middle East can no longer bear more conflict and instability, and the international community must work together to prevent further escalation of the situation in the region, he said.

Israel has agreed to resume Gaza ceasefire talks on August 15 at the demand of US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Thursday, as regional tensions skyrocket over the war. In a joint statement on Thursday, the three countries' leaders invited the warring parties to resume talks on August 15 in Doha or Cairo ""to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay"". A framework agreement was ""now on the table, with only the details of implementation"" left to conclude, and the mediators were ""prepared to present a final bridging proposal"" to resolve remaining issues, they said. Netanyahu's office said later Thursday Israel would send a negotiating team on August 15 ""to the agreed place to conclude the details of implementing a deal"". ...Palestinian movement Hamas is refusing an invitation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt to participate in the final round of talks with Israel on a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, scheduled for August 15, the Axios portal reported, citing the movement’s statement..... Mediators in ceasefire-hostage talks between Israel and Hamas are making a renewed push to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table, as fears of an imminent Iranian attack on Israel threaten to escalate the conflict into a wider regional war. The leaders of the United States, Qatar and Egypt said on Thursday they may present what they called a “final bridging proposal” next week, urging Israel and Hamas to conclude a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. On Thursday night, the mediators stepped up the pressure on Israel and Hamas to resume talks in either Cairo or Doha next week. A source familiar the discussions told CNN that a meeting is being planned for August 15 and is expected to happen, but Israel and Hamas need to confirm their attendance. ...The negotiations involve US CIA Director William Burns, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Egyptian Intelligence Chief General Abbas Kamel, and Israeli Mossad Chief David Barnea. Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said late on Thursday that long-stalled cease-fire talks in Doha would continue for a second day as planned on Friday. The spokesman said mediators from Qatar, Egypt and the United States were working towards reaching a truce that would facilitate the release of hostages and enable the largest possible amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza.  Hamas, which governs Gaza, refused to attend the latest round of talks. Instead, it said mediators should impose terms and ""compel"" Israel to comply. Hamas and the mediators, however, say the group is still participating indirectly....Among those participating in the negotiations in Qatar are CIA Chief William Burns, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, as well as the head of Israel's foreign intelligence service Mossad, David Barnea.... Hamas is not participating, but the Palestinian militant organization is reportedly being continuously informed about the content of the talks, dpa has learnt from sources....But Kirby said Sinwar, who is understood to be hiding somewhere in Gaza, will not directly participate in the talks.He explained that mediators in Doha would have discussions, then mediators would communicate with Hamas leaders, who would in turn “communicate directly with Mr Sinwar for for final answers.” “So the process that is playing out in Doha, very much, in keeping with the process that has played out in the past,” he said... Previously, Hamas had said that it would not be part of the talks with Israel being mediated by Egypt and Qatar and facilitated by the United States. But the terrorist group had said that it was open to engaging with the mediators after their meeting with the Israeli delegation to discuss if Israel had any meaningful offer....Mediators in the Gaza cease-fire talks announced on Friday that they proposed a new plan to bridge gaps between Israel and Hamas. “Over the last 48 hours in Doha, senior officials from our governments have engaged in intensive talks as mediators aiming to conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees,” according to a joint statement by Egypt, Qatar and the US. The statement further noted that technical teams from Egypt, Qatar, and the US will “work over the coming days on the details of implementation, including arrangements to implement the agreement’s extensive humanitarian provisions, as well as specifics relating to hostages and detainees.” A new “implementation cell” was established in Cairo that will focus on the logistics of the deal, including the release of hostages, humanitarian aid to Gaza and monitoring the implementation of the deal’s terms, the official said. It also mentioned that senior officials from the three countries will “reconvene in Cairo before the end of next week with the aim to conclude the deal under the terms put forward today.” While the terms of the bridging proposal were not officially released, Hamas says the latest plan includes new provisions that skew heavily in Israel’s favour. Those include Israel’s refusal of a full ceasefire and a complete troop withdrawal from Gaza. Israel has also reportedly insisted on keeping control of the Rafah border crossing, the Philadelphi Corridor that borders Egypt and the Netzarim Corridor, which separates the northern part of Gaza from the south. In a sign that mediators believe a Gaza cease-fire deal is imminent, a U.S. official said Friday that Mideast negotiators are working out logistics for the potential release of hostages and distribution of aid as part of any agreement to end the Israel-Hamas war. They said two days of talks had wrapped up in Qatar and that they plan to reconvene in Cairo next week to seal an agreement to stop the

He is set to meet with Netanyahu on Monday.... U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to arrive in Israel on Sunday as part of Washington's intensifying diplomatic push to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza that will end the 10-month-old war between Israel and Hamas. The top U.S. diplomat's ninth trip to the region since the war began in October last year comes days after the United States put forward bridging proposals that it and mediators Qatar and Egypt believe would close gaps between the warring parties.... Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Israel on Saturday as part of the United States’s efforts to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas. Blinken will “continue intensive diplomatic efforts to conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement on Friday..... U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned to travel to Israel over the weekend to “continue intensive diplomatic efforts” toward a cease-fire and to underscore the need for all parties in the region to avoid escalation, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said. Blinken was expected to meet with Netanyahu on Monday to discuss the new deal, said an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official requirements....The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will arrive in Tel Aviv in Israel today as part of Washington’s diplomatic push to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. This is his ninth trip to the West Asia since Hamas terrorists attacked southern Israel in October last year. Blinken, according to Israeli officials will meet the President of Israel, Issac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant. Sources also said that the US Secretary of State will meet David Barnea, Mossad director and Shin Bet chief, who were part of the indirect peace talks in Doha, Qatar. ...Antony Blinken flew into Tel Aviv on Sunday as part of Washington’s renewed efforts to broker a ceasefire in the 10-month-old conflict, negotiations seen as even more urgent after last month’s back-to-back assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander and the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh. The US’s top diplomat will seek to “conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees” during his ninth visit to the region since the war broke out following Hamas’s 7 October attack, the state department said. Blinken is expected to meet senior leaders including Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday before travelling on to Egypt. ...U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge differences holding up a cease-fire and hostage release in Gaza, and he called on Hamas to do the same, without saying whether concerns cited by the militant group had been addressed. Blinken spoke after holding a 2 1/2 hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in the day, and will travel to Egypt and Qatar for further negotiations. The three mediators have spent months trying to end the war in Gaza, with the talks repeatedly stalling. ...Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Monday the Israeli prime minister had accepted a Biden administration proposal to close some of the remaining gaps on a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and he urged Hamas “to do the same.” A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu, Omer Dostri, confirmed the prime minister had told Mr. Blinken that Israel had accepted the proposal, which American officials presented last week with the support of Egypt and Qatar in an attempt to stop the fighting in Gaza and avert a wider regional war. But officials in both Israel and Hamas have said the plan, known as a “bridging proposal,” left major disagreements unresolved, and they voiced intense skepticism over the likelihood of an imminent deal. Some Israeli officials privately expressed skepticism that the American proposal would result in a breakthrough with Hamas. Mr. Blinken’s comments came after he met for nearly three hours with Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and afterward he sought to put pressure on both sides to come to an agreement.... On 19 August, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he received confirmation, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel accepted a “bridging proposal” recently put forward by the US, adding that it was then “incumbent on Hamas to do the same”.",https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2024/08/16/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-the-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-regional-conflict;https://www.euronews.com/2024/08/19/antony-blinken-arrives-in-israel-in-bid-to-seal-gaza-ceasefire-deal-after-10-months-of-war;https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-to-arrive-in-israel-as-us-pushes-for-gaza-cease-fire/7747038.html;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3627136/;;https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3599161/;https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/5710373/;https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3523691/;https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3364487/;https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3622862/;https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3945343/;https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/diplomacy-intensifies-to-halt-israel-hamas-war-and-prevent-wider-conflict/3489531/;https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/blinken-to-visit-israel-amid-ceasefire-talks-5707372;https://www.rte.ie/news/2024/0817/1465405-gaza-lebanon/;https://www.yahoo.com/news/blinken-arrive-israel-us-pushes-040205393.html;https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/394773;https://theindianawaaz.com/blinken-visit-to-israel-as-part-of-washingtons-push-to-achieve-ceasefire-in-gaza/;https://www.albawaba.com/news/secretary-blinken-visit-israel-today-1581781;https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/6/219525/Blinken-to-arrive-in-Israel-as-US-pushes-for-Gaza-ceasefire;https://en.apa.az/asia/blinken-arrives-in-israel-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks-445521;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/blinken-arrives-israel-11th-hour-talks-gaza-ceasefire-deal;https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2024/0818/1465495-middle-east-israel/;https://www.clickorlando.com/news/world/2024/08/18/blinken-is-back-in-the-middle-east-to-press-for-the-conclusion-of-an-israel-hamas-ceasefire/;https://infotel.ca/newsitem/ml-israel-united-states/cp1694432450;https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/aug/18/blinken-arrives-in-israel-to-push-cease-fire-deal-/;https://siouxcityjournal.com/israel-palestinians-blinken-visit/article_5dfe365d-c39c-5b68-a053-bbc24e4f9e86.html;https://www.thepacket.ca/antony-blinken-arrives-in-israel-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks/;https://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/World/20240819/4226448.html;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-war-live-updates-benjamin-yoav-gallant-netanyahu-antony-blinken-tel-aviv-gaza-ceasefire-hamas/liveblog/112616078.cms;https://infotel.ca/newsitem/ml-israel-palestinians-truce-talks/cp121616032;https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-secretary-state-meet-netanyahu-051115509.html;https://www.news4jax.com/news/world/2024/08/19/blinken-in-israel-says-now-is-maybe-the-last-chance-for-a-gaza-cease-fire-deal/;https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-815287;https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/national/24526499.blinken-says-now-maybe-last-chance-gaza-ceasefire-deal/;https://www.singletonargus.com.au/story/8733972/now-maybe-the-last-chance-for-gaza-ceasefire-deal/;https://www.yahoo.com/news/blinken-says-now-maybe-last-071125496.html;https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-blinken-says-netanyahu-supports-cease-fire-deal/live-69975178;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/us-secretary-of-state-says-gaza-cease-fire-talks-maybe-last-chance-to-end-war/3307370;https://pakistankakhudahafiz.com/25-additional-gazans-are-slain-by-israel-as-blinken-shows-up-for-cease-fire-negotiations/;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/19/world/israel-iran-hamas-gaza-war#blinken-is-in-israel-to-push-for-a-gaza-cease-fire-deal;https://www.khaama.com/blinken-arrives-in-tel-aviv-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks/;https://www.aol.co.uk/news/latest-talks-between-hamas-israel-094446597.html;https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274498193/blinken-current-talks-maybe-the-last-opportunity-for-gaza-truce;https://tribune.com.pk/story/2489254/gaza-ceasefire-still-possible-us-president-biden;https://tass.com/pressreview/1830739;https://www.orissapost.com/netanyahu-blinken-hold-private-meeting-in-jerusalem/;https://www.firstpost.com/world/israel-hamas-talks-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release-deal-antony-blinken-last-opportunity-13806080.html;https://www.edenmagnet.com.au/story/8733972/now-maybe-the-last-chance-for-gaza-ceasefire-deal/?cs=14264;https://cbn.com/news/israel/blinken-arrives-push-gaza-ceasefire-hezbollah-pummels-northern-israel;https://www.yahoo.com/news/blinken-meets

There was no agreement on Sunday in the Gaza ceasefire talks that took place in Cairo, with neither Hamas nor Israel agreeing to several compromises presented by mediators, two Egyptian security sources said, casting doubt on the chances of success in the latest US-backed effort to end the 10-month old war.

However, he said that despite all the work that needs to be done, an end to the war in Gaza is “ultimately a question of political will.” Currently, Burns said, the US is working with mediators in Egypt and Qatar to refine a framework proposed by Biden in May and “put it in a form, a good enough proposal” that both the Israeli and Hamas leaderships will see the value in moving ahead with it. He stressed that in his experience with Middle East negotiations, “perfect is never on the menu,” adding that he could not say for sure that “we’re going to succeed in that,” nor how close the US and mediators might be to a deal right now. “It is a fact that if you look at the written text, 90% of the paragraphs have been agreed to.

The top U.S. diplomat's latest trip - his eleventh to the region since Palestinian Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7 triggering the Gaza war - comes as the Israeli military has intensified its campaign in the Palestinian enclave as well as in Lebanon against Iran-aligned Hezbollah militia. On Gaza, Blinken will focus discussions on how to end the war, plans for the enclave after the fighting ends and how to improve humanitarian assistance, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ...Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday in the first big U.S. push for a Middle East ceasefire since Israel killed the leader of Hamas last week – and the last attempt before a presidential election that could upend U.S. policy. Blinken was meeting Netanyahu and other officials at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. U.S. officials say he is exploring plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, key to reaching a ceasefire. State Department officials said Blinken intended to raise the issue of what happens in Gaza when the war ends, focusing on security, governance and reconstruction. Washington has long said it ideally wants Gaza reunited with the West Bank under a government run by the Palestinian Authority, which now exercises limited self-rule in that Israeli-occupied territory....In a statement, the office said that Netanyahu discussed post-war Gaza governance with the United states Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He also expressed hope that the killing of Hamas’s leader would help hostage release. “Both sides discussed the issue of governance in Gaza in the aftermath of the war. The prime minister emphasised that the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar could have a positive impact on the return of the hostages” held in Gaza for more than a year, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement issued after the meeting with Secretary of State Blinken in Jerusalem, according to AFP. ...“We talked about the plan that we’ve had on the table and the work that we’re doing on that plan, looking at new frameworks of foreign relations as a possibility,” Blinken said. Work on that deal — mediated by Hamas and Qatar — came to a halt when Hamas executed six of the hostages, including US-Israeli citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin at the end of August. While in Israel, Blinken said, he talked about “the importance of determining whether Hamas is prepared to engage in moving forward, and the Egyptians, the Qataris are doing just that.” The US had viewed Sinwar as an obstacle to making a deal and had hoped that his death would open a new opportunity to make a deal. “We have to end the war in a way that keeps Hamas out, makes sure that Israel doesn’t stay” in Gaza, he said.",https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/21/us-to-make-another-push-to-defuse-conflicts-in-middle-east/;https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/21/breaking-news/blinken-to-make-another-push-for-middle-east-ceasefires/;https://www.yahoo.com/news/blinken-heads-israel-revive-gaza-011947004.html;https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/22/sirens-sounded-in-central-israel-after-a-projectile-crossed-from-lebanon/;https://athens-times.com/israel-took-out-hezbollahs-funding-manager-in-syria/;https://www.dw.com/en/un-rights-chief-condemns-israeli-strike-near-beirut-hospital/live-70563832;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13986977/Blinken-Israel-push-ceasefire-Hamas-leader-Yahya-Sinwar.html;https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239888;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/middleeast/washingtons-arab-allies-engage-with-iran-intl/;https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/blinken-in-israel-to-push-for-gaza-truce-1.104450719;https://www.firstpost.com/world/netanyahu-blinken-discuss-israeli-hostage-release-governance-of-post-war-gaza-13828105.html;https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-825734;https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/blinkens-11th-visit-to-israel-can-us-secretary-of-states-latest-trip-revive-cease-fire-efforts-amid-escalating-tensions-with-hezbollah/3646914/;https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2024/10/23/2003825722;https://www.nysun.com/article/blinken-again-in-israel-as-biden-attempts-to-stem-jerusalems-response-to-the-iranian-missile-attack;https://www.firstpost.com/world/blinken-presses-netanyahu-to-publicly-deny-siege-of-north-gaza-discusses-ceasefire-hostage-deal-13828165.html;https://www.jwire.com.au/friendly-and-productive-2-5-hour-meeting-with-blinken-in-jerusalem-netanyahu-says/;https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/10/us-says-now-time-end-gaza-war;https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/us-says-now-is-the-time-to-end-gaza-war-201848;https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-825837;https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/israel-wont-be-distracted-by-ceasefire-talks/;https://egyptian-gazette.com/world/blinken-says-war-in-gaza-should-end-now/;https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-seeks-egypts-help-truce-talks-hamas;https://www.india.com/news/world/fragile-peace-on-the-horizon-israel-explores-de-escalation-with-hezbollah-and-hamas-7345399/;https://www.naharnet.com:443/stories/en/308827-israel-pounds-dahieh-levelling-residential-complex;https://yalibnan.com/2024/10/24/now-is-the-time-to-end-gaza-war-us-says/;https://www.egyptindependent.com/washingtons-arab-allies-engage-with-iran-as-us-efforts-to-stem-middle-east-violence-falter/;http://www.hngn.com/articles/263478/20241023/us-says-now-time-end-gaza-war.htm;https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-blinken-c450119702081057ff6c816d6a19e51a;https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/heres-a-look-at-what-came-out-of-blinkens-11th-trip-to-the-middle-east-3196584/;https://infotel.ca/newsitem/united-states-mideast-blinken-takeaways/cp1020611776;https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2024/oct/26/heres-a-look-at-what-came-out-of-blinkens-11th-trip-to-the-middle-east-tfp/;,1,M

Pedersen and Director of Operations and Advocacy at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Edem Wosornu briefed the Council on the political and humanitarian tracks in Syria, respectively. Two civil society representatives also participated at the meeting—Regional Vice President (Middle East and North Africa) at the International Rescue Committee Su’ad Jarbawi and Abir Haj Ibrahim, a peacebuilder from Syria. Pedersen highlighted the urgent need to prevent Syria from becoming “a free-for-all venue, where different actors settle their scores or fuel other theatres, nor a staging ground for attacks or retaliation”. He called for de-escalating regional tensions and for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. He also expressed concern about the prospect of further escalations between Israel and Iran and what this could mean for Syria. Moreover, he cautioned that regional escalation posed a risk of undermining ceasefire agreements that, despite their imperfections, have maintained a crucial freeze in the front lines within Syria for nearly four years.On the political front, Pedersen noted that partial, piecemeal or conflict-management approaches alone could not tackle the scale of the ever-mounting challenges facing Syria. He remarked that Syria would continue to be embroiled in crises unless the long-stalled Syrian-owned and -led political process facilitated by the UN resumes and begins to move forward. He underlined the need to develop a “new and comprehensive” path out of the conflict, one that addresses the political issues central to the conflict as well as issues pertaining to sovereignty, security, civilian protection, and economic issues.In her remarks, Wosornu stressed the need to ensure the safety and security of Syrians who are fleeing Lebanon under extreme duress and the freedom to reach their preferred destinations. She also called for unhindered access for the humanitarian organisations providing aid to those arriving and all people in need. She said that the humanitarian response is now shifting to providing assistance to people in the areas where they have settled and to support host families and communities, “many of whom are themselves already stretched to breaking point”. She said that attacks at the Lebanon-Syria border crossings have rendered the roads impassable for vehicles, forcing people to cross the border on foot. In addition, she pointed to the disruptions caused in the transport of humanitarian assistance and commercial goods because of damage to the roads connecting Lebanon and Syria.Wosornu also highlighted the UN inter-agency emergency appeal for $324 million for the influx from Lebanon to Syria to support up to 480,000 people over the next six months. This appeal is in addition to Syria’s 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which requires $4.07 billion. At the time of writing, the HRP was only 27.2 percent funded.

As the conference closed, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, told participants: “In total, we have jointly gathered $800m in humanitarian aid.” He said there was a further $200m for Lebanon’s official security forces, bringing the total to “almost a billion, even more than a billion … with the latest contributions”.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi publicly proposed an initial two-day ceasefire in which four Israeli hostages would be exchanged with an unidentified number of Palestinian prisoners.[18] This would be followed by 10 days of further negotiations. Sisi’s proposed plan bears a resemblance to the proposal of Egyptian General Intelligence Service head Hassan Rashad on October 22 for a “small” ceasefire-hostage deal that would facilitate negotiations for a more comprehensive ceasefire-hostage deal.[19] A Palestinian source close to the negotiations told Reuters that Hamas would ”listen” to new offers but remains committed to achieving a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.[20] Hamas likely believes that it can survive and recover in the Gaza Strip by waiting out the Israelis, making it unclear why a smaller ceasefire-hostage deal would facilitate successful talks.[21] An Israeli source told Israeli media on October 27 that Netanyahu is willing to conclude the IDF operations in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in exchange for a diplomatic resolution that guarantees Israel’s war aims are achieved.[22] Israeli media reported that Israeli officials intend to host a follow-up summit soon to continue negotiations, with the involvement of Egyptian Intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, and potentially Hamas.[23]...On 27 October, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and the release of the hostages resumed in Qatar after a prolonged lull.

The people of Sudan face an ever-deepening crisis as the relentless war between rival militaries pushes the country further into chaos, the UN’s top political affairs official told the Security Council on Tuesday, underscoring that a ceasefire and a negotiated political solution remain the only viable path to peace. “Sudan is trapped in a nightmare,” Rosemary DiCarlo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs told ambassadors, echoing the grim declaration made by the Secretary-General two weeks ago. Calling for an immediate ceasefire, Ms. DiCarlo underscored that an end to fighting is the most effective way of protecting civilians. “It is long past time for the warring parties to come to the negotiating table. The only path out of this conflict is a negotiated political solution.” While rival militaries might not be ready for a negotiated settlement, Sudan’s partners have a responsibility to press them to work for one, she said, commending the African Union (AU), the regional development body, IGAD, and the international group supporting humanitarian efforts and peace talks, ALPS – for their attempts to bring the rival generals to the negotiating table. The UN will continue to engage with warring parties through Ramtane Lamamra, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan, including through regional visits and proximity talks, she added. Ramesh Rajasingham, Director for Coordination at OCHA, told ambassadors that humanitarian organizations “remain unable to reach the vast majority of people in conflict hotspots across Sudan at anything approaching adequate scale.” .... Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Monday calling for an immediate end to hostilities in Sudan where a war between two rival generals has been raging since April 2023. A draft of the resolution prepared by Britain and Sierra Leone, which was seen by AFP, had called on both sides to ""immediately cease hostilities"" and begin talks on ""a national ceasefire."" .... On 12 November, the Council held a high-level briefing on the situation in Sudan. Briefing at the meeting, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA) Rosemary DiCarlo strongly condemned the RSF’s attacks on civilians and the SAF’s indiscriminate airstrikes in populated areas. She stressed that both parties bear responsibility for the ongoing violence, highlighting that a cessation of hostilities is the most effective way to protect civilians. DiCarlo pointed to the continued escalation of military operations, the recruitment of new fighters, and intensified attacks by both sides, enabled by “considerable external support,” including a steady influx of weapons into the country. She criticised the role of external actors in fuelling the conflict, describing their involvement as “unconscionable” and “illegal”.DiCarlo said that the Personal Envoy of Secretary-General Ramtane Lamamra is considering the next phase of his engagement with the warring parties, including another round of “proximity talks” focused on commitments related to the protection of civilians. She urged immediate action to implement the Jeddah Declaration, signed by both parties on 11 May 2023 and highlighted the importance of a compliance mechanism to hold the parties accountable to their commitments. She underlined the need to make progress on achieving local ceasefires that could create avenues for dialogue and potentially lay the ground for a more comprehensive agreement...... Tomorrow morning (12 November), the Security Council will convene for a high-level briefing on the situation in Sudan. The UK’s Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Africa, Lord Collins of Highbury, will chair the meeting. Briefings are expected from Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, Head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Geneva and Director of the Coordination Division Ramesh Rajasingham, and a civil society representative. Sudan is expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure. Tomorrow, the briefers and several Council members are expected to condemn the ongoing violence across Sudan and reiterate the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities. They might highlight the imperative to ensure accountability and justice for victims of violence and call on the parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. As both sides continue to pursue military means to influence the conflict’s outcome, mediation efforts have failed to achieve a breakthrough. Consequently, Council members are apparently focusing on how to protect civilians in this fragile environment.",https://allafrica.com/stories/202411040027.html;https://www.yahoo.com/news/un-security-council-considers-action-232457452.html;https://www.globalissues.org/news/2024/11/12/38237;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/11/mil-241112-unnews02.htm;http://jordantimes.com/news/world/russia-vetoes-sudan-ceasefire-resolution-un;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/11/mil-241118-unsc01.htm;https://news.az/news/-sudan-in-chaos-why-did-russia-use-its-veto;https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/sudan-briefing-4.php;https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-12/sudan-32.php;https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15893.doc.htm;https://press.un.org/en/2024/db241112.doc.htm,0,MR

""This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,"" Mr Biden said. Israel will gradually withdraw its forces over a period of 60 days as Lebanon's army takes control of territory near its border with Israel to ensure that Hezbollah does not rebuild its infrastructure there, Mr Biden said. The Lebanon ceasefire agreement requires Israeli troops to withdraw from south Lebanon and Lebanon's army to deploy in the region, officials say. Hezbollah would also end its armed presence along the border south of the Litani River. The Lebanon ceasefire agreement requires that Israeli troops withdraw from south Lebanon allowing Lebanon's army to deploy in the region, officials say. ... Israel is poised to approve a US-brokered cease-fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah on Tuesday, potentially bringing an end to 14 months of conflict that erupted alongside the Gaza war. A senior Israeli official said the security cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to discuss and likely endorse the proposal during a high-level meeting later in the day. The cease-fire plan, already approved by Lebanese officials, would include an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon within 60 days and the deployment of the Lebanese Army to the region, a stronghold for Hezbollah. Elias Bou Saab, Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker, confirmed there are no major obstacles remaining, barring last-minute changes from Netanyahu.... The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war. At least 42 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities....In a joint statement, President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal ""will cease the fighting in Lebanon, and secure Israel from the threat of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon."" They said it ""will create the conditions to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to their homes"" along the border. ...After discussions with the governments of the republic of Lebanon (hereinafter “Lebanon”) and the state of Israel (hereinafter “Israel”), the United States of America and France understand that Lebanon and Israel seek a sustainable end to the current escalation of hostilities across the Blue Line and are each prepared to take steps to promote conditions for a permanent and comprehensive solution. These understandings reflect steps to which Israel and Lebanon are committed in order to implement fully UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701, recognising that UNSCR 1701 also calls for full implementation of its predecessor UNSC resolutions, including “disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon”, so that the only forces authorised to carry arms in Lebanon will be the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), Internal Security Forces, Directorate of General Security, General Directorate of State Security, Lebanese Customs and Municipal Police (hereinafter “Lebanon's official military and security forces”)..... Israel and Lebanon will implement a cessation of hostilities beginning at 4am, November 27, 2024 in accordance with the commitments detailed below. Lebanon will prevent Hezbollah and all other armed groups in Lebanon from carrying out operations against Israel, and Israel will not carry out any offensive military operations against Lebanese targets in the territory of Lebanon. Both will take steps towards the implementation of UNSCR 1701. Lebanon's offiical military and security forces will be the only armed forces deployed in the southern Litani area. Arms sales and production will be regulated in Lebanon. Lebanon will monitor the unauthorised entry of arms and related material into Lebanon, and will dismantle any unauthorised military and armed infrastructure. Both will reinforce the tripartite mechanism with UNIFIL. Lebanon will deploy official military to all borders. Israel and Lebanon requested that the US and the UN facilitate indirect negotations between them to resolve the remaining disputed points along the Blue Line.",https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-830697;https://www.rte.ie/news/2024/1126/1482999-israel-lebanon-hezbollah/;https://themedialine.org/headlines/report-israeli-official-says-government-ready-to-approve-cease-fire/;https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/israel-palestinians-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-11-26-2024-l52152;https://www.palestinechronicle.com/surrender-agreement-lebanon-israel-ceasefire-expected/;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/what-would-a-ceasefire-between-israel-and-hezbollah-entail-and-would-it-be-successful;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-netanyahu-war-lebanon-gaza-hamas/;https://www.yahoo.com/news/netanyahu-recommends-approval-ceasefire-deal-183900211.html;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-lebanon-ceasefire-war-news-b2654097.html;https://newschannel9.com/news/nation-world/israels-truce-with-hezbollah-brings-some-peace-to-middle-east-enveloped-in-war-hamas-gaza-lebanon;https://kansaspublicradio.org/npr-news/2024-11-26/israel-agrees-to-a-ceasefire-with-hezbollah-that-could-stop-the-war-in-lebanon;https://www.yahoo.com/news/president-biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-210618298.html;https://themedialine.org/top-stories/cease-fire-deal-between-israel-and-hezbollah-takes-effect-wednesday/;https://english.news.cn/20241127/dd5a2507ac8140119e1d2b2999154862/c.html;https://english.news.cn/20241127/0851339f536e497ca7583da565fc3790/c.html;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/11/26/israel-approves-proposed-ceasefire-with-lebanons-hezbollah;https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-israel-lebanon-officially-agree-212113802.html;https://knsiradio.com/2024/11/26/israel-approves-proposed-ceasefire-with-lebanons-hezbollah/;https://english.news.cn/20241127/c24bc9161cff48fb8048eb0f11b65874/c.html;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/26/biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-agreement;https://www.waka.com/2024/11/26/israel-and-lebanons-hezbollah-agree-to-a-ceasefire-to-end-nearly-14-months-of-fighting/;https://www.bigcountry995.com/story/67463654c2defddc5e6e26d4/president-biden-announces-israel-and-hezbollah-have-agreed-to-ceasefire;https://www.voanews.com/a/ceasefire-deal-hezbollah-to-move-north-of-litani-river-israeli-troops-to-gradually-withdraw/7877957.html;https://www.odt.co.nz/news/world/netanyahu-ready-ceasefire-deal-lebanon;https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/world/israel-agrees-to-ceasefire-with-hezbollah-lebanon-demands-for-immediate-action/;https://www.asiaone.com/world/israel-hezbollah-agree-ceasefire-brokered-us-and-france;https://www.dailyfinland.fi/worldwide/40652/Israel-Lebanon-ceasefire-to-take-effect-Wednesday;http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2024-11/27/content_117571075.htm;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/israel-hezbollah-agree-to-ceasefire-brokered-by-us-and-france-to-take-effect-wednesday/articleshow/115713634.cms;https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274794839/xinhua-world--summary-at-0030-gmt-nov-27;https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/737993/Biden--Israel-Lebanon-ceasefire-will-come-into-effect-today;https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/11/26/evening-edition-israel-agrees-to-ceasefire-with-hezbollah-will-it-last/;https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2024/11/27/us-and-france-broker-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-after-13-months-of-conflict/;http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1127/c90000-20247081.html;https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/what-does-the-us-brokered-truce-ending-israel-hezbollah-fighting-include;https://www.yahoo.com/news/president-biden-announces-peace-deal-020537750.html;https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/five-key-points-on-the-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-deal-1.1732673414234;https://www.watoday.com.au/world/middle-east/what-does-the-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-include-20241127-p5ktta.html;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/world-hails-israel-lebanon-cease-fire-deal-as-relief-for-region/3405684;http://www.china.org.cn/world/2024-11/27/content_117571306.htm;https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41525126.html;https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/6/223194/Five-key-points-on-the-Israel-Hezbollah-ceasefire-deal;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/world/2024/11/501_387148.html;https://thewillnews.com/president-biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-deal/;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-lebanon-ceasefire-hezbollah-gaza-b2654860.html;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/11/mil-241126-voa03.htm;https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-lebanon-latest-pressure-netanyahu-090358512.html;https://en.gmw.cn/2024-11/27/content_37702753.htm;https://www.news18.com/explainers/israel-lebanon-ceasefire-what-do-we-know-about-the-deal-will-this-impact-gaza-war-9135435.html;https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netanyahu-announces-move-toward-ceasefire-in-lebanon-along-with-stark-warning/;https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/27-Nov-2024/israel-hezbollah-enter-us-brokered-ceasefire-after-year-long-conflict;https://dailypost.ng/2024/11/27/israel-agrees-to-ceasefire-with-hezbol
